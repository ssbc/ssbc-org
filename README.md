# SSBC organisation

## Purpose

The Secure Scuttlebutt Consortium exists to support the development of [Secure-Scuttlebutt](https://github.com/ssbc/secure-scuttlebutt), and to support the community to develop tools using this new protocol-database.

Examples of community support are : 

- [Patchwork](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork) : a proof of concept communications app built on SSB
- [SSB guides](https://github.com/ssbc/docs)


## Internal Strucutre

The Consrtium's internal organisational structure has been adapted from that of the [Apache Foundation](http://www.apache.org/foundation/) and the [Enspiral Foundation](https://github.com/enspiral/agreements).

### Contributors

Anyone is welcome to contribute to the Consortium through pull requests, design insights, comms, or discussion.
People who have contributed a lot to the Consortium over a period of time can be invited to become a Member.


### Members 

Members are a group of people who steward the Consortium. They do work that supports the SSBCs purpose, and make strategic and financial decisions that inform this work. 
Most conversations in the Consortium are open for participation by default, but some decisions will be made by members alone.
